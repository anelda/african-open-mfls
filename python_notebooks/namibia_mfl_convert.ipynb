    "A master facility list (MFL) contains the full complement of health facilities of a country, including those in public as well as private sector. The list should include the geographic location of each facility along with other attributes such as the type of facility (e.g. hospital, clinic, pharmacy, or other), services rendered, infrastructure available, and more. The World Health Organisation published a [guide for the development and strengthening of MFLs](https://www.who.int/healthinfo/country_monitoring_evaluation/mfl/en/).\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of African countries have started to develop master health facility lists. Namibia, amongst others, have taken the extra steps to make the data available online via an application programming interface (API).\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of work around MFLs in Africa, we accessed the [Namibian MFL](https://www.who.int/healthinfo/country_monitoring_evaluation/mfl/en/) API using the Python code below. This data will be used in further comparisons with other MFLs from Africa."

The first call gets `facilities.json` that contains a list of facilities and their location but most importantly, allows us to access the ID of each facility. In a subsequent API call, we can use the facility ID to get a JSON file containing detailed information about each facility, including services and infrastructure available.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below we will download a JSON file as Python dictionary. The JSON contains several layers of nesting. A single key `locations` contains a list of dictionaries with keys `id`, `parent_id`, `name`, `long_name`, `contact_person`, `phone_number`, `alt_phone_number`, `address`, `catchment_population`, `point_x`, `point_y`, `location_type`, `location_ownership`, `children`. In this dictionary the `id` refers to the ID of the region.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each `locations`.`children` contains another dictionary called `children` that contains keys `id`, `parent_id`, `long_name`, `contact_person`, `phone_number`, `alt_phone_number`, `address`, `catchment_population`, `point_x`, `point_y`, `location_type`, `location_ownership`, `children`.\n",
