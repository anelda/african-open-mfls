# Looking at open datasets for health facilities in Africa

In March 2020 we started working on the afrihealthsites package to make African health facility data more accessible 
for analysis, visualisation, and to allow others to combine it more easily with other datasets. 
[Macharia et al (2020)](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.27.20113803v1), 
for example, created vulnerability indices to assist with prioritisation and improved planning specifically with the COVID-19
epidemic, but also beyond this crisis. This kind of data can be overlayed onto health facility data to identify gaps and 
inform decision-makers if health facility data is readily accessible.

Over the past month the afrimapr team have been looking into health facility data for Africa. This repository contains R code and an 
HTML report sharing what we've learned.

A blog post about this is also available [on our website](https://afrimapr.github.io/afrimapr.website/blog/2020/african-open-health-facility-data/).
